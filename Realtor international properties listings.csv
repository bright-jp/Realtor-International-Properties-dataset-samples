Oversized windows span the back of the home, showcasing the breathtaking landscape from the kitchen, dining, family, and living rooms. Hardwood floors, ornate leaded glass fixtures, and Andersen windows create timeless charm, while a granite-surround gas fireplace adds warmth. The daylight basement includes a full bath, bedroom, kitchenette, bonus room and private entrance-ideal for guests, multigenerational living, or flexible workspace. Outdoors, a covered deck and steel-anchored gazebo invite year-round enjoyment surrounded by mature landscaping. The grounds are a dream with a curated collection of fruit and nut trees: figs, apples, apricots, cherries, pears, plums, blueberries, grapes, pineapple guava, kiwi, and hardy pecans. Utility costs are impressively low thanks to full-home insulation, a 22kW whole-house generator, and 28 solar panels producing 8kW-electric bills average just $500/year and 2024 gas bill was $63/month. The barn is structurally reinforced and outfitted with power, water, solar, 2 Priefert horse stalls and a 12x12 tack room. Chinook is known for its scenic tranquility, friendly neighbors, and stately, high-value estates. This incredible home offers the rare combination of efficiency, privacy, and absolutely unforgettable views!","[""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1893638951s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3802992152s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3129887881s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m23475647s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2879632652s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1996454247s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m4107175072s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1067862081s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3360952278s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3846943098s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2802050867s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1081427159s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2590588690s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2534954358s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m266254577s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3343091186s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m410145555s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3197012918s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1487650889s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m185921995s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m827489403s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2745095731s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2738549876s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m4164955497s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m4138654129s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m368668540s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2167726125s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m2787010733s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1403124337s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3292078254s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3922744157s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3473318333s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m164709068s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m751100980s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m4167872293s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3795801206s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1747033058s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3612555376s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3341381410s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3360952278s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3508308267s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3785230882s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m4134550783s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1602996635s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m1974257772s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m4127055998s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3178248401s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/d4d3f07f5dc085445fabaaacd53cf22el-m3199887935s-w960_h720.jpg""]",5,3,"single_family","3996 sqft","74488 sqft","[""Bedrooms: 5"",""Total Bathrooms: 3.0"",""Partial Bathrooms: 0"",""Full Bathrooms: 3"",""Bathrooms On Main Level: 2.0"",""Full Bathrooms On Main Level: 2"",""Bathrooms On Lower Level: 1.0"",""Full Bathrooms On Lower Level: 1"",""Bathrooms On Upper Level: 0.0"",""Basement Description: Daylight,Finished,SeparateLivingQuartersApartmentAuxLivingUnit""]","3834 W Nanitch Cir S, Salem, OR 97306","USA","Oregon","Salem","{""agency"":""eXp***alt***LLC***"",""agency_url"":""htt***//k***kel*********/"",""name"":""Kate K***y"",""phone_number"":""888***961***""}",,"Sold"

Tenants can ask Landlord for permission to sign up for the Bren Mar Swimming Pool, Tennis and recreation area. This is an agreement between Bren Mar and Jefferson Green, and my Tenants have really enjoyed the swimming pool.

The unfinished lower level is brimming with potential (yes, there's a bath rough-in ready to go). The oversized three-car garage and main floor laundry make everyday life a little easier. Step outside and imagine summer nights under the pergola on your stamped concrete patio-it's the perfect entertaining space. Did we mention fully-fenced? And when you want to get out, you're minutes from Wentzville favorites like Sugarfire Smoke House, Duke's BBQ Shack, the Brass Rail, and shopping at Wentzville Parkway. Quick access to Hwy 70 and 40/61 makes commuting simple too. This is such a beauty! Come by and take a tour!","[""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m3670089198s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m24588514s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m142067203s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1352814777s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m14165176s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m210840045s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m3939814979s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m3353404813s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m3815692886s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1971838773s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m563064187s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m2414967500s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1527024690s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m3311266277s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m171492181s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1403996609s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m2714109374s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m3702935003s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m858230306s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m2184867838s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1226992445s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1926893221s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m4253366248s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1095450600s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m2369100853s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m2773257940s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1806563974s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m3275449156s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m754632538s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1500516349s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m1622639474s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m2629220286s-w960_h720.jpg"",""https://ap.rdcpix.com/09f3b858cebfa39ddd986020939f3e31l-m2558449194s-w960_h720.jpg""]",4,2.5,"single_family","2540 sqft","9313 sqft","[""Bedrooms: 4"",""Bedrooms On Upper Level: 4"",""Total Rooms: 9"",""Total Bathrooms: 3"",""Full Bathrooms: 2"",""1/2 Bathrooms: 1"",""Half Bathrooms On Main Level: 1"",""Full Bathrooms On Upper Level: 2""]","225 Turning Mill Dr, Wentzville, MO 63385","USA","Missouri","Wentzville","{""agency"":""Exp***alt***Llc***"",""agency_url"":""htt***//k***ohn*********r.c******"",""name"":""Kat J*****n"",""phone_number"":""866***176***""}",,"Sold"
